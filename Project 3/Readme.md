# Car Price Prediction Project

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors such as the goodwill of the brand, features of the car, horsepower, mileage, and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. If you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model, then this project is for you.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will explore the various factors affecting car prices and build a machine learning model to predict the price of used cars. The project will involve:

- Data exploration and cleaning
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
