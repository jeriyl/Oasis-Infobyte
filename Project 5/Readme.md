# Sales Prediction using Python

## Introduction

Sales prediction involves estimating how much of a product will be purchased based on various factors, such as advertising spend, target audience segmentation, and advertising platforms. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques in Python to predict future sales for a product or service-based business.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from [Kaggle: Advertising Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bumba5341/advertisingcsv).

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **TV**: Advertising budget allocated for TV
- **Radio**: Advertising budget allocated for radio
- **Newspaper**: Advertising budget allocated for newspaper
- **Sales**: Sales generated from the advertising

## Objectives

- Analyze the relationship between advertising spend and sales.
- Build predictive models to forecast sales based on advertising budgets.
- Evaluate model performance and accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
