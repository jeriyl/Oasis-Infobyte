# Internship Projects

Welcome to my internship project repository! This repository contains five projects I completed this during my internship at Oasis Infobyte Solutions. Each project is organized in its own folder.

## Projects

1. **Iris Flower Classification**
   - **Description:** A machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species based on the lengths and widths of their petals and sepals.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Matplotlib

2. **Unemployment Analysis with Python**
   - **Description:** An analysis of unemployment data to identify trends and patterns across different regions and time periods.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

3. **Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning**
   - **Description:** A predictive model to estimate car prices based on various features such as year, mileage, and fuel type.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy

4. **Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning**
   - **Description:** A classification model that detects whether an email is spam or not using machine learning techniques.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NLTK

5. **Sales Prediction using Python**
