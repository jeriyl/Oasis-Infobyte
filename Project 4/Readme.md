# Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

## Overview

We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.

In this project, we will use Python to build an email spam detector. We will leverage machine learning techniques to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam categories.
