Iris Flower Classification
Overview
This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their measurements. We use the well-known Iris dataset and apply machine learning techniques to develop a classification model using Scikit-learn.

Dataset
The dataset consists of 150 samples with four features each:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
The target variable is the species of the iris flower:

0: Setosa
1: Versicolor
2: Virginica
Libraries Used
numpy: For numerical operations.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, and then install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
How to Run the Project
Clone the repository or download the files.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python iris_classification.py
Code Explanation
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using load_iris() from Scikit-learn.
Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split().
Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data.
Predictions: The model makes predictions on the test set.
Evaluation: The model's accuracy is evaluated, and a detailed classification report is generated.
Results
The model's accuracy and a classification report are printed to the console, indicating the performance of the classifier on the test dataset.

Conclusion
The project demonstrates the application of machine learning for classifying iris flower species based on their measurements. Further improvements can be made by experimenting with different algorithms or tuning hyperparameters.
