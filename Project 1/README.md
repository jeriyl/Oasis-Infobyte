Iris Flower Classification
Overview
This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their measurements. The project uses the well-known Iris dataset and applies machine learning techniques to develop a classification model using Scikit-learn.

Dataset
The dataset consists of 150 samples with four features:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
The target variable is the species of the iris flower, represented as:

0: Setosa
1: Versicolor
2: Virginica
Libraries Used
numpy: For numerical operations.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
